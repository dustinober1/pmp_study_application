While reviewing the draft Project Charter, you notice that the Measurable Success Criteria are vague, stating only, 'Improve customer satisfaction.' However, the Business Case strongly implies that the primary goal is to reduce operational support costs by 25% within 18 months post-launch. The Sponsor, who is the CIO, seems focused only on meeting the technical delivery date. What is the MOST important action you should take regarding the Project Charter?",
