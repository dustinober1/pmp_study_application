During a review of the preliminary Project Charter, a senior functional manager, who is a key stakeholder, states that the project's success criteria seem disconnected from the stated business case, which focuses on regulatory compliance, while the charter emphasizes operational efficiency gains. You know the Sponsor signed the charter, but this manager has significant influence over resource allocation. What is the BEST course of action for the Project Manager regarding this discrepancy?",

While the Charter is the authorization, ignoring a high-influence stakeholder's valid concern about strategic misalignment (Value vs. Compliance) is poor leadership. The Charter's success criteria MUST align with the Business Case/Strategic goals, as noted in the content. Ignoring this suggests a weak Strategic Anchor.",
