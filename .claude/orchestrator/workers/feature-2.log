I have completed Phase 2: PayPal Integration. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Files Created

1. **`backend/app/services/paypal_service.py`** (NEW)
   - Complete PayPal service with order creation, capture, and subscription management
   - Support for both one-time payments and recurring subscriptions
   - Webhook signature verification and IPN message handling
   - Automatic OAuth token management with refresh logic
   - Pricing: $14.99/month or $119.99/year

2. **`backend/app/routers/paypal.py`** (NEW)
   - `POST /api/paypal/checkout` - Create checkout session
   - `POST /api/paypal/webhook` - Handle webhook events
   - `POST /api/paypal/webhook/ipn` - Handle IPN messages
   - `GET /api/paypal/subscription` - Get current subscription
   - `POST /api/paypal/subscription/cancel` - Cancel subscription

## Files Modified

3. **`backend/app/config.py`** - Added PayPal configuration fields for credentials, webhook, and plan IDs

4. **`backend/app/main.py`** - Registered PayPal router

The implementation includes full webhook handling for subscription lifecycle events (activation, cancellation, expiration) with automatic user tier management. The subscription model already existed in the codebase.
