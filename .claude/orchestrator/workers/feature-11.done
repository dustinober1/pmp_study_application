Feature 11: Create Progress API Routes - COMPLETED

## Summary
Implemented two progress tracking API endpoints:

### 1. GET /api/progress/summary
Returns overall user progress summary including:
- Overall statistics: total/reviewed/mastered flashcards, total/attempted/correct questions
- Study session metrics: total sessions, total study time, study streak
- Flashcard and question accuracy percentages
- Last study date
- Progress breakdown by domain (3 domains: People, Process, Business Environment)

### 2. GET /api/progress/domain/{domain_id}
Returns detailed progress for a specific domain including:
- Domain-level summary (same stats as overall but filtered to domain)
- Progress breakdown by task within the domain

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `backend/app/routers/progress.py` - New router with both endpoints

### Modified:
- `backend/app/schemas/progress.py` - Added `TaskProgressSummary` and `DomainDetailedProgressResponse` schemas
- `backend/app/main.py` - Registered progress router

## Implementation Details

- Both endpoints require `X-Anonymous-ID` header for user identification
- User is created automatically on first API call if not exists
- Flashcard mastery is defined as ease_factor >= 2.5 AND repetitions >= 3
- Study streak calculation considers consecutive days of study sessions
- Accuracy is calculated as (correct / total * 100) with 1 decimal precision
- All queries are optimized to fetch only necessary data

## API Authentication
Uses anonymous user flow with browser-generated UUID in `X-Anonymous-ID` header.
