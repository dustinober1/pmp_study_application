# Phase 4b: Smart Study Roadmap - COMPLETED

## Summary

Implemented the Smart Study Roadmap feature, which provides AI-generated personalized study curricula that adapt weekly based on exam date, study time, and user progress.

## Backend Implementation

### Models (backend/app/models/roadmap.py) - ALREADY EXISTED
- `StudyRoadmap`: Main roadmap model with exam date, study preferences, status, and AI-generated recommendations
- `RoadmapMilestone`: Weekly milestones with daily study plans and completion criteria
- `MilestoneStatus`: pending, in_progress, completed, skipped
- `RoadmapStatus`: active, paused, completed, archived

### RoadmapGenerator Service (backend/app/services/roadmap_generator.py) - ALREADY EXISTED
- `create_roadmap()`: Generates personalized curriculum based on exam date and study time
- `adapt_roadmap()`: Adjusts remaining milestones based on current performance
- `get_daily_plan()`: Retrieves study plan for a specific date
- `update_milestone_progress()`: Tracks milestone completion
- Scheduling algorithm allocates domains across weeks based on PMP 2026 ECO weights (People 33%, Process 41%, Business Environment 26%)
- Prioritizes weak domains identified from user analytics

### API Endpoints (backend/app/routers/roadmap.py) - ALREADY EXISTED
- `POST /api/roadmap/create` - Create new study roadmap
- `GET /api/roadmap/active` - Get user's active roadmap
- `GET /api/roadmap/{id}` - Get specific roadmap
- `GET /api/roadmap/{id}/daily/{date}` - Get daily study plan
- `PUT /api/roadmap/{id}/milestones/{mid}` - Update milestone progress
- `POST /api/roadmap/{id}/adapt` - Adapt roadmap to progress
- `DELETE /api/roadmap/{id}` - Archive roadmap

## Frontend Implementation

### API Client (frontend/src/lib/api/roadmap.ts) - ALREADY EXISTED
- Full TypeScript types for all roadmap entities
- Functions for all roadmap API operations

### StudyRoadmapView Component (frontend/src/components/roadmap/StudyRoadmapView.tsx) - ALREADY EXISTED
- Displays overall roadmap progress with visual indicators
- Shows AI recommendations and focus areas
- Lists all milestones with status and progress
- Quick actions for adapt and archive
- Empty state prompting roadmap creation

### RoadmapSetupWizard Component (frontend/src/components/roadmap/RoadmapSetupWizard.tsx) - ALREADY EXISTED
- Multi-step wizard (3 steps) to create personalized roadmap
- Step 1: Select exam date with weeks calculation
- Step 2: Set weekly study hours with intensity indicator
- Step 3: Set study days per week with summary
- Creates roadmap on completion

### DailyStudyPlan Component (frontend/src/components/roadmap/DailyStudyPlan.tsx) - CREATED
- Shows daily breakdown for a milestone
- Displays progress tracking for flashcards and questions
- Shows daily study plans with activities
- Actions to start and complete milestones
- Visual progress bars and completion criteria

## Key Features

1. **AI-Powered Scheduling**: Algorithm allocates study content across available weeks using PMP domain weights
2. **Weak Domain Focus**: Identifies user's weak areas from analytics and allocates extra time
3. **Weekly Adaptation**: Roadmap adjusts based on completed milestones and performance
4. **Daily Study Plans**: Each milestone includes detailed daily plans with activities
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for flashcards, questions, and quiz scores
6. **Exam Countdown**: Shows days remaining until exam date

## Integration

- Models exported in backend/app/models/__init__.py
- Router registered in backend/app/main.py
- Frontend components follow existing patterns with SWR for data fetching
- Anonymous user flow supported via X-Anonymous-ID header
