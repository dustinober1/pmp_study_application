   - Optional email field for registered users (unique, indexed)
   - Optional display_name
   - created_at, updated_at timestamps
   - Relationships to FlashcardProgress, QuestionProgress, StudySession

2. `backend/app/models/progress.py` - Progress tracking models
   - FlashcardProgress: SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm fields
     - ease_factor (default 2.5)
     - interval, repetitions
     - next_review_at, last_reviewed_at

   - Timing fields: started_at, ended_at, duration_seconds
   - Metrics: flashcards_reviewed/correct, questions_answered/correct
