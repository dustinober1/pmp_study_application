You are a worker agent focused on implementing a single feature.

## Your Task
Phase 2A: Create SQLAlchemy models for Domain, Task, Flashcard, Question tables with relationships

## Orchestration Context
Build a PMP 2026 Study Application - a web-based exam preparation tool with flashcards, practice tests, and progress tracking organized by PMP 2026 ECO Domains and Tasks.

Technology Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand (state), SWR (data fetching)
- Backend: Python FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic (migrations)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Hosting: Render

PMP 2026 ECO Structure:
- Domain 1: People (33% weight, 8 tasks)
- Domain 2: Process (41% weight, 10 tasks)
- Domain 3: Business Environment (26% weight, 8 tasks)

Key features: Anonymous user sessions, SM-2 spaced repetition for flashcards, practice tests with immediate feedback, progress tracking with visualizations.

## Project Overview

PMP 2026 Study Application - a web-based exam preparation tool with flashcards, practice tests, and progress tracking organized by PMP 2026 ECO Domains and Tasks.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand (state), SWR (data fetching)
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic (migrations)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: Render

## Development Commands

### Frontend (from `frontend/` directory)
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (localhost:3000)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run test         # Run tests
```

### Backend (from `backend/` directory)
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload              # Start dev server (localhost:8000)
pytest                                      # Run all tests
pytest tests/test_flashcards.py -v         # Run single test file
pytest -k "test_create_user"               # Run tests matching pattern
alembic upgrade head                        # Apply migrations
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "msg"   # Generate migration
python -m app.seed.pmp_2026_data           # Seed database
```

## Architecture

### Data Model Hierarchy
```
Domain (1:N) → Task (1:N) → Flashcard/Question
                 ↓
User → FlashcardProgress (SM-2 spaced repetition)
    → QuestionProgress
    → StudySession
```

### Key Patterns

**Anonymous User Flow**: Users start with a browser-generated UUID stored in localStorage. On first API call, backend creates a user record. Optional email registration upgrades the anonymous user while preserving progress.

**Spaced Repetition (SM-2)**: Flashcard reviews use the SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm with ease_factor starting at 2.5. Next review interval = previous_interval × ease_factor.

**API Client**: Frontend uses SWR with optimistic updates for responsive UI during progress tracking.

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/domains` - List domains with tasks
- `GET /api/flashcards?domain=&task=` - Filterable flashcards
- `POST /api/flashcards/:id/review` - Submit review result
- `GET /api/questions?domain=&task=` - Filterable practice questions
- `POST /api/questions/:id/answer` - Submit answer
- `GET /api/progress/summary` - User progress overview

## PMP 2026 ECO (Exam Content Outline)

Effective July 2026. The exam has 185 questions (175 scored), 240 minutes, covering 40% predictive and 60% adaptive/agile/hybrid approaches.

### Domains (26 Tasks Total)

| Domain | Weight | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **People** | 33% | Leadership, team dynamics, stakeholder engagement |
| **Process** | 41% | Planning, execution, monitoring, adaptation |
| **Business Environment** | 26% | Strategic alignment, governance, value delivery |

### People Domain Tasks
- Lead the project team (expectations, empowerment, problem-solving, leadership style)
- Help ensure knowledge transfer
- Identify and analyze stakeholders
- Tailor communication to stakeholder needs
- Execute stakeholder engagement plan
- Build trust and influence stakeholders

### Process Domain Tasks
- Define, break down, and obtain agreement on scope
- Prioritize work based on value and stakeholder feedback
- Assess opportunities for incremental value delivery
- Define and manage resources
- Plan and execute procurement
- Recommend project management approach (predictive, adaptive, hybrid)
- Create and maintain integrated project management plan
- Collect and analyze data for informed decisions

### Business Environment Domain Tasks
- Evaluate external business environment changes (regulations, technology, geopolitical, market)
- Assess impact on project scope/backlog
- Help ensure value-based delivery
- Verify measurement systems for tracking benefits

### New Emphasis Areas (2026)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) in project management
- Sustainability considerations
- Continu

## Instructions
1. Focus ONLY on implementing this specific feature
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Test your changes as you go
4. When you are DONE, create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-4.done
   with a brief summary of what you implemented
5. Do NOT commit your changes - the orchestrator will handle commits

## Important
- Do not work on other features
- If you encounter a blocker, document it in the .done file and stop
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- NEVER commit, stage, or git add ANY of these files:
  - .claude/ (entire directory - orchestrator state, logs, prompts, worker files)
  - claude-progress.txt
  - init.sh
  - *.prompt, *.log, *.done, *.status files in .claude/



Begin implementing the feature now.
