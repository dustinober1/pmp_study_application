## Project Context Files
### From CLAUDE.md:
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PMP 2026 Study Application - a web-based exam preparation tool with flashcards, practice tests, and progress tracking organized by PMP 2026 ECO Domains and Tasks.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand (state), SWR (data fetching)
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic (migrations)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: Render

## Development Commands

### Frontend (from `frontend/` directory)
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (localhost:3000)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run test         # Run tests
```

### Backend (from `backend/` directory)
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload              # Start dev server (localhost:8000)
pytest                                      # Run all tests
pytest tests/test_flashcards.py -v         # Run single test file
pytest -k "test_create_user"               # Run tests matching pattern
alembic upgrade head                        # Apply migrations
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "msg"   # Generate migration
python -m app.seed.pmp_2026_data           # Seed database
```

## Architecture

### Data Model Hierarchy
```
Domain (1:N) → Task (1:N) → Flashcard/Question
                 ↓
User → FlashcardProgress (SM-2 spaced repetition)
    → QuestionProgress
    → StudySession
```

### Key Patterns

**Anonymous User Flow**: Users start with a browser-generated UUID stored in localStorage. On first API call, backend creates a user record. Optional email registration upgrades the anonymous user while preserving progress.

**Spaced Repetition (SM-2)**: Flashcard reviews use the SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm with ease_factor starting at 2.5. Next review interval = previous_interval × ease_factor.

**API Client**: Frontend uses SWR with optimistic updates for responsive UI during progress tracking.

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/domains` - List domains with tasks
- `GET /api/flashcards?domain=&task=` - Filterable flashcards
- `POST /api/flashcards/:id/review` - Submit review result
- `GET /api/questions?domain=&task=` - Filterable practice questions
- `POST /api/questions/:id/answer` - Submit answer
- `GET /api/progress/summary` - User progress overview

## Instructions
1. Focus ONLY on implementing this specific feature
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Test your changes as you go
4. When you are DONE, create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-4.done
   with a brief summary of what you implemented
5. Do NOT commit your changes - the orchestrator will handle commits

## Important
- Do not work on other features
- If you encounter a blocker, document it in the .done file and stop
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- NEVER commit, stage, or git add ANY of these files:
  - .claude/ (entire directory - orchestrator state, logs, prompts, worker files)
  - claude-progress.txt
  - init.sh
  - *.prompt, *.log, *.done, *.status files in .claude/


## Additional Context
IMPORTANT: Start working immediately - read files first, then implement step by step.

Phase 4a: Exam Day Simulator

STEP 1 - Read existing files:
- backend/app/models/user.py
- backend/app/models/exam.py
- backend/app/routers/exams.py

STEP 2 - Create backend/app/models/exam_behavior.py:
- ExamBehaviorProfile model with: user_id, avg_time_per_question, time_variance, flag_frequency, second_guess_correct_rate, panic_threshold

STEP 3 - Create backend/app/services/exam_coach_service.py:
- Pattern detection (rush, dwell, panic)
- Coaching message generation
- Pacing recommendations

STEP 4 - Update backend/app/routers/exams.py:
- Add POST /api/exams/{id}/analyze-behavior
- Add GET /api/exams/{id}/coaching-tips
- Add GET /api/exams/{id}/game-tape

STEP 5 - Create frontend components:
- frontend/src/components/exam/ExamCoachPanel.tsx
- frontend/src/components/exam/PostExamGameTape.tsx

Work methodically through each step.
