Phase 5a: Concept Graph Explorer is now complete. 

## Summary

This feature was **already largely implemented** in the codebase. My work completed the missing frontend component.

### What Already Existed:

**Backend:**
- `backend/app/models/concept.py` - ConceptTag, ConceptRelationship models with junction tables
- `backend/app/services/concept_graph_builder.py` - Full graph builder service with pathfinding, mastery calculation, subgraph generation
- `backend/app/routers/concepts.py` - Complete API endpoints for concepts

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/lib/api/concepts.ts` & `concept-hooks.ts` - API client and SWR hooks
- `frontend/src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript types for concepts
- `frontend/src/components/concept/ConceptGraphExplorer.tsx` - D3.js force-directed graph visualization with zoom, drag, tooltips, and mastery indicators

### What I Added:

**`frontend/src/components/concept/ConceptDetailView.tsx`** - A detail view component that:
- Shows concept description, category, and domain
- Displays user mastery progress with visual progress bar
- Lists related concepts (incoming and outgoing relationships)
- Provides tabs for Overview, Flashcards, and Questions
- Supports click-through to related concepts
- Includes a "Study This Concept" action button

**`frontend/src/components/concept/index.ts`** - Barrel export for easier imports
