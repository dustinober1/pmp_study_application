I have successfully implemented the progress API routes. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Completed: Phase 3D - Progress API Routes

### Created Endpoints:

1. **GET /api/progress/summary** - Returns overall user progress summary with:
   - Overall statistics (flashcards, questions, sessions, study time)
   - Flashcard/question accuracy percentages
   - Study streak tracking
   - Progress breakdown by all 3 PMP domains

2. **GET /api/progress/domain/{domain_id}** - Returns detailed progress for a specific domain with:
   - Domain-level summary
   - Progress breakdown by task within the domain

### Files Modified:
- `backend/app/schemas/progress.py` - Added `TaskProgressSummary` and `DomainDetailedProgressResponse` schemas
- `backend/app/routers/progress.py` - New file with both endpoints
- `backend/app/main.py` - Registered the progress router

### Key Implementation Details:
- Uses anonymous user authentication via `X-Anonymous-ID` header
- Flashcard mastery defined as ease_factor >= 2.5 AND repetitions >= 3
- Study streak calculated based on consecutive study session days
- All syntax verified and passes compilation checks
