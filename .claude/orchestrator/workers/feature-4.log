I have completed Phase 4a: Exam Day Simulator implementation. Here's a summary:

## Implementation Complete

### What Was Already Implemented (Backend):
1. **ExamBehaviorProfile Model** - Tracks behavioral patterns, engagement/focus scores, timing metrics
2. **ExamCoachService** - Pattern detection, coaching message generation, game tape creation
3. **API Endpoints** - `/coach/metrics`, `/coach/summary`, `/coach/gametape`
4. **TypeScript Types** - Complete type definitions for behavior metrics and game tape

### What I Added:
1. **PostExamGameTape Component** (`frontend/src/components/exam/PostExamGameTape.tsx`)
   - Chronological timeline of all exam behaviors
   - Event filtering (all, concerns, coaching)
   - Visual indicators with pattern detection
   - Expandable details with domain info and insights

2. **ExamEngine Integration** (`backend/app/services/exam_engine.py`)
   - Modified `submit_answer()` to call the coach service
   - Behavior tracking now occurs automatically on every answer submission
   - Handles revisits and records coaching alerts

### Key Features:
- Real-time behavioral pattern detection (rushing, dwelling, panic, guessing)
- Engagement and focus scoring (0-100)
- Pace trajectory analysis (ahead, on_track, behind, critical)
- Live coaching panel with pattern-specific hints
- Post-exam "game tape" for behavioral review
