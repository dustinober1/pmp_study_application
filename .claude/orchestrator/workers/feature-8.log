Feature 8 is complete. I created:

1. **`backend/app/routers/domains.py`** - New router with three endpoints:
   - `GET /api/domains` - List all domains with their tasks
   - `GET /api/domains/{domain_id}` - Get a specific domain with its tasks
   - `GET /api/domains/{domain_id}/tasks` - Get tasks for a specific domain

2. **Modified `backend/app/main.py`** - Added import and registration of the domains router

The implementation:
- Uses existing Pydantic schemas (`DomainWithTasksResponse`, `DomainResponse`, `TaskResponse`)
- Uses existing SQLAlchemy models (`Domain`, `Task`)
- Implements proper eager loading with `selectinload` to avoid N+1 queries
- Orders domains and tasks by their `order` field
- Returns appropriate HTTP 404 errors when resources are not found
