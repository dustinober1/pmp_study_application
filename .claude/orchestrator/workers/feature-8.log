Implementation verified. All components for Phase 6: Adaptive Explanations exist and are properly integrated.

**Summary:**

**Backend (Complete):**
- `backend/app/models/explanation.py` - ExplanationTemplate, ExplanationHistory, UserLearningPreference models
- `backend/app/services/adaptive_explanation.py` - AdaptiveExplanationEngine service with methods for getting, rating, and tracking explanations
- `backend/app/routers/explanations.py` - Full REST API for explanations, preferences, and analytics
- Router registered in `main.py`
- Models exported in `models/__init__.py`
- User model has `learning_preferences` relationship

**Frontend (Complete):**
- `frontend/src/components/explanation/AdaptiveExplanationPanel.tsx` - Multi-tab explanation panel with style selector and feedback buttons
- `frontend/src/components/explanation/TeachBackMode.tsx` - Teach-back verification UI with analysis
- `frontend/src/components/explanation/index.ts` - Component exports

**Outstanding:** Database migration requires PostgreSQL running to generate with `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add_explanation_tables"`.

The `.done` file already exists at `.claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-8.done` with full documentation.
