# Feature 3: PostgreSQL, Alembic, and CORS Configuration

## Completed

### PostgreSQL Connection
- Reviewed existing configuration in `backend/app/database.py`
- PostgreSQL connection is properly configured with:
  - Connection pooling (pool_size=5, max_overflow=10)
  - Pool pre-ping for connection health checks
  - Configurable DATABASE_URL via environment variables

### Alembic Migration Setup
- Updated `backend/alembic.ini` with clear comments explaining that the database URL is set programmatically from app.config
- Enhanced `backend/alembic/env.py` with placeholder imports for all planned models (User, Domain, Task, Flashcard, Question, FlashcardProgress, QuestionProgress, StudySession)
- Alembic is ready for autogenerate migrations once models are defined

### CORS Configuration
- Enhanced `backend/app/config.py` with improved CORS configuration:
  - Default includes both `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
  - Supports comma-separated list for multiple origins
  - Added helpful comments for configuration
- Updated `backend/.env.example` to reflect the CORS configuration format
- CORS middleware is properly configured in `backend/app/main.py` with:
  - Credentials support enabled
  - All HTTP methods allowed
  - All headers allowed

## Files Modified
- `backend/alembic.ini` - Added comment explaining programmatic URL override
- `backend/alembic/env.py` - Added model import placeholders for future use
- `backend/app/config.py` - Enhanced CORS default to include 127.0.0.1
- `backend/.env.example` - Updated CORS_ORIGINS example

## Notes
- Models need to be created in a separate feature before migrations can be generated
- Database needs to be created manually: `createdb pmp_study`
- After models are defined, run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial"` to create the first migration
