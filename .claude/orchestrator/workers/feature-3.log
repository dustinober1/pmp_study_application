The implementation is complete. Let me provide a final summary:

## Phase 3: Tier Enforcement - COMPLETE

### Summary
The tier enforcement infrastructure was already implemented in the backend. I verified all existing components and created the frontend `TierGate` component and hooks.

### What Was Done

**Backend (Verified - Already Existed)**
- `backend/app/middleware/tier_middleware.py` - Complete with `LimitType`, `TierGate`, `enforce_limit()`, `LimitExceededError`
- `backend/app/services/usage_service.py` - Complete with `UsageService`, tier limits config, daily/monthly tracking
- Routers already using `enforce_limit()` decorators on flashcard reviews, question answers, and exam creation

**Frontend (Created)**
- `frontend/src/components/TierGate.tsx` - Modal component showing tier limits, reset times, upgrade CTAs, tier comparison
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTierGate.ts` - `useTierGate()`, `useTierGuard()`, `createTierAwareFetcher()` hooks for easy integration

### Tier Limits Enforced
| Tier | Flashcards | Questions | Mini Exams | Full Exams |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Public | 50/day | 30/day | 1/day | 0 |
| Free | Unlimited | Unlimited | 2/month | 0 |
| Premium | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
