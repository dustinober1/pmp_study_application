Feature 3 (Phase 1C) has been completed. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

**PostgreSQL Connection Configuration:**
- Reviewed the existing setup in `backend/app/database.py` - already well-configured with connection pooling and pre-ping health checks
- Configuration loads from environment variables via `backend/app/config.py`

**Alembic Migration Setup:**
- Updated `backend/alembic.ini` with comments clarifying that the database URL is set programmatically from app.config settings
- Enhanced `backend/alembic/env.py` with placeholder imports for all planned models (User, Domain, Task, Flashcard, Question, FlashcardProgress, QuestionProgress, StudySession)

**CORS Configuration:**
- Enhanced the default CORS configuration to include both `http://localhost:3000` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Updated `.env.example` with the improved CORS configuration format
- CORS middleware is already properly configured in `main.py` with credentials, all methods, and all headers allowed

The `.done` file has been created at `.claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-3.done` with the full implementation details.
