I have completed Phase 7: Frontend Integration & Polish. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

### Already Completed (from previous work):
1. **Pricing page** (`frontend/src/app/pricing/page.tsx`) - Full three-tier pricing with monthly/annual toggle, feature comparison, FAQ
2. **UserStore tier state** - Tier state (`public`|`free`|`premium`), premium expiration tracking, access helper methods
3. **Sidebar navigation** - Premium features section with locked icons, tier badge, upgrade CTA
4. **Header** - Tier badge display, premium star indicator
5. **Dashboard** - Tier badge, upgrade CTA card, exam countdown

### Added (this session):
6. **Telemetry System** (`frontend/src/lib/telemetry.ts`) - NEW comprehensive tracking system:
   - Tracks 11 different event types (page views, feature clicks, upgrades, exam starts, etc.)
   - `useTelemetry` hook for easy component integration
   - `withPageTracking` HOC for automatic tracking
   - Ready for `/api/telemetry` backend endpoint
   - Silent failure - won't break the app if API is down

7. **Telemetry Integration**:
   - **Exam page** - Tracks page views, premium feature access, exam start events
   - **Pricing page** - Tracks page views, upgrade clicks by tier
   - **Dashboard** - Tracks page views, upgrade CTA clicks

All telemetry events automatically include user tier, page URL, timestamp, and optional metadata - enabling feature usage analysis by tier.
