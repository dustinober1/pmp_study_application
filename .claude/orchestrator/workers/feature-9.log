Feature 9 (Phase 3B: Flashcard API Routes) has been completed. Here's a summary:

## Completed Implementation

### Endpoints Created:

1. **GET /api/flashcards** - List flashcards with optional domain/task filtering and pagination
2. **GET /api/flashcards/due/count** - Get count of flashcards due for review
3. **GET /api/flashcards/{flashcard_id}** - Get single flashcard by ID
4. **POST /api/flashcards/{flashcard_id}/review** - Submit flashcard review with SM-2 algorithm

### SM-2 Algorithm:
- Full implementation with quality ratings 0-5
- Ease factor calculation and clamping (1.3-2.5)
- Interval scheduling (1 day, 6 days, then EF-based)
- Reset on failed responses

### Fixes Applied:
- Fixed type mismatch in `FlashcardProgress.flashcard_id` (UUID → Integer)
- Fixed type mismatch in `QuestionProgress.question_id` (UUID → Integer)
- Updated schema to match model types
