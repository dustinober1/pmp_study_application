## Feature 5 Complete

I have successfully implemented Phase 2B - creating SQLAlchemy models for User, FlashcardProgress, QuestionProgress, and StudySession tables.

### Files Created:

1. **`backend/app/models/user.py`** - User model with:
   - UUID primary key
   - `anonymous_id` for browser-generated UUIDs (supports anonymous users)
   - Optional `email` for registered users
   - Relationships to progress and session tables

2. **`backend/app/models/progress.py`** - Two models:
   - `FlashcardProgress` - SM-2 spaced repetition tracking (ease_factor, interval, repetitions, next_review_at)
   - `QuestionProgress` - Practice question attempt tracking

3. **`backend/app/models/session.py`** - StudySession model with:
   - Session type enum (flashcard, practice_test, mixed)
   - Domain/task filtering
   - Duration and performance metrics

### Files Modified:

1. **`backend/app/models/__init__.py`** - Added exports for all new models
2. **`backend/alembic/env.py`** - Enabled model imports for Alembic autogenerate
