Feature implementation complete. I created 5 base UI components with Tailwind styling:

1. **Button** - Primary, secondary, ghost, danger, success variants with loading states and icons
2. **Card** - With CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter sub-components
3. **Modal** - Portal-based with ESC close, overlay click, and accessibility
4. **Input** - With label, helper text, error states, and icons
5. **Select** - With options, placeholder, and custom styling

All components:
- Use TypeScript with proper typing
- Support dark mode
- Have multiple size variants (sm, md, lg)
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Pass ESLint with no errors
