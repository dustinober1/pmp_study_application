# Phase 5a: Concept Graph Explorer - COMPLETE

## Summary

Phase 5a (Concept Graph Explorer) was already largely implemented in the codebase. This worker completed the missing `ConceptDetailView` component.

## What Was Already Implemented

### Backend (Complete)
1. **Models** (`backend/app/models/concept.py`):
   - `ConceptTag` - PMP concept/topic model with categories and domain focus
   - `ConceptRelationship` - Relationships between concepts (prerequisite, related, part_of, enables, contradicts)
   - `FlashcardConcept` - Junction table for flashcard-concept associations
   - `QuestionConcept` - Junction table for question-concept associations

2. **Service** (`backend/app/services/concept_graph_builder.py`):
   - `ConceptGraphBuilder` class with methods for:
     - `get_full_graph()` - Full concept knowledge graph
     - `get_subgraph()` - Subgraph centered on a specific concept
     - `get_concept_details()` - Detailed concept information
     - `get_learning_path()` - Pathfinding between concepts
     - `search_concepts()` - Concept search functionality
     - Mastery level calculation based on user progress

3. **API Router** (`backend/app/routers/concepts.py`):
   - `GET /api/concepts` - List concepts with filtering
   - `GET /api/concepts/graph` - Get full knowledge graph
   - `GET /api/concepts/categories` - Get all categories
   - `GET /api/concepts/domains` - Get domains with concepts
   - `GET /api/concepts/{id}` - Get concept details
   - `GET /api/concepts/{id}/subgraph` - Get concept subgraph
   - `GET /api/concepts/{id}/path` - Find learning path
   - `GET /api/concepts/{id}/flashcards` - Get concept flashcards
   - `GET /api/concepts/{id}/questions` - Get concept questions
   - `GET /api/concepts/search/{query}` - Search concepts

### Frontend (Mostly Complete)
1. **API Layer** (`frontend/src/lib/api/concepts.ts`, `concept-hooks.ts`):
   - All API functions and SWR hooks implemented

2. **Types** (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`):
   - `ConceptTag`, `ConceptRelationship`, `ConceptGraphResponse`
   - `ConceptDetails`, `ConceptListResponse`, `LearningPath`
   - `ConceptCategory`, `ConceptDomain`, `RelationshipType`

3. **Component** (`frontend/src/components/concept/ConceptGraphExplorer.tsx`):
   - D3.js force-directed graph visualization
   - Interactive node dragging and zoom
   - Domain and relationship type legends
   - Mastery level indicators
   - Tooltips with concept details
   - Node click handling for detail view

## What This Worker Implemented

### New Frontend Component
**`frontend/src/components/concept/ConceptDetailView.tsx`**
- Displays detailed information about a selected concept
- Three tabs: Overview, Flashcards, Questions
- Shows related concepts (incoming and outgoing relationships)
- Displays user mastery progress if available
- Lists related flashcards and questions for study
- Click-through to related concepts
- Responsive design with dark mode support

**`frontend/src/components/concept/index.ts`**
- Barrel export for concept components

## Key Features
1. **Visual Knowledge Graph** - D3.js force-directed layout showing concept relationships
2. **Interactive Exploration** - Click nodes to view details, drag to reposition, scroll to zoom
3. **Relationship Visualization** - Color-coded relationship types with directional arrows
4. **Mastery Tracking** - User progress integrated into graph visualization
5. **Domain Filtering** - Filter graph by PMP domain (People, Process, Business Environment)
6. **Learning Paths** - BFS-based pathfinding between concepts
7. **Subgraph Views** - Focus on specific concept neighborhoods

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, D3.js v7, SWR, TypeScript
- **Visualization**: Force-directed graph with zoom, drag, and hover interactions
